            <h3>Menu One</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt>Amazing Vegan Mac and Cheese</dt>
              <dd>Did you know that this seven-year-old vegetarian food blog did not have a macaroni and cheese recipe until today? It’s true.</dd>
              <dt>Sugar Snap Pea and Carrot Soba Noodles</dt>
              <dd>Let’s talk about this soba dish before I succumb to the couch. It is pretty fantastic and green, just like the fledgling leaves sprouting from the trees outside.</dd>
              <dt>Kale, Black Bean & Avocado Burrito Bowl</dt>
              <dd>Last week, Cookie and I zoomed up to Minneapolis to visit a friend. It was a long drive, long enough to justify lots of seat squirming as all the hills and trees started looking the same, but we made it there and we made it back. </dd>
              <dt>Creamy (vegan!) Butternut Squash Linguine with Fried Sage</dt>
              <dd>My dog, Cookie, and I have been visiting the vet three times a week lately. We don’t mind the excursion. </dd>
              <dt>Sweet Potato & Black Bean Veggie Burgers</dt>
              <dd>It’s about time I told you all about my friend Bill. I’ve mentioned him before, but never by name. Bill is a badass. He’s a cancer survivor, a true fighter. </dd>
            </dl>
            <article>
            <h3>Menu Two</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt>Vegetable Paella</dt>
              <dd>I’m so excited about this paella recipe! I hope you are, too. Paella is a beautiful rice dish hailing from the east coast of Spain, near the port city of Valencia.</dd>
              <dt>Spicy Thai Peanut Sauce over Roasted Sweet Potatoes and Rice</dt>
              <dd>Please tell me that I am not the only girl who leaves her keys in the door. Or loses her car in parking lots. Or drops her wallet on the sidewalk.</dd>
              <dt>Spaghetti Squash Burrito Bowls</dt>
              <dd>Man alive! Monday snuck up on me after a weekend away. (Park City, Utah—have you been? It’s my new favorite mountain town.)</dd>
              <dt>Spiced Vegan Lentil Soup (AKA the Best!)</dt>
              <dd>This soup recipe was a long time coming! Over the years, I made some lackluster lentil soups that never saw the light of day on this website.</dd>
              <dt>Spicy Sweet Potato and Green Rice Burrito Bowls</dt>
              <dd>Cookie and Kate are finally back in the kitchen. I still wasn’t feeling in the mood up until a couple of nights ago, when I spent a few hours cleaning out the cabinets and the refrigerator.</dd>
