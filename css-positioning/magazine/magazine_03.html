        <p class="one">The mirror-as-device has fragmented and multiplied, penetrating the most intimate, personal scale and reframing our subjectivity. Now, it is not only the outside that is reflected but also and foremost our inner landscapes, a shift mirroring capital coming full circle, colonizing our emotion and affect. At the same time, the production of images has been outsourced:</p>
        <p class="two">capital’s iconic figure, the self-made man, has exploded to new heights produced and disseminated via repeated selfies and scrolls by the current citizen-entrepreneur: the 24/7 independent precarious worker. </p>
        <p class="three">The prosumer now autonomously produces and consumes its own images of entrapment. BIM, the Biennale de l’Image en Mouvement, opened in November 2018 and is curated by Andrea Lissoni, senior curator of international art (film) at Tate Modern, and Andrea Bellini, director of the Centre d’Art Contemporain Genève.</p>
        <p class="four">Presenting twenty artists and collectives, the biennial foregrounds the curators’ take on the current status of the moving image, building on the idea that the main model of encountering moving images has shifted from collectively projected events in large spaces to individualized experiences grounded in static or mobile flat-screen devices. Florent Meng’s brilliant The Lost Line (2018) tells the story of an abandoned tunnel built by political prisoners and peasants in the Cantabrian Mountains, where now stands a laboratory researching dark matter from University of Saragoza. Framed by a powerful soundtrack and flirting with the documentary format, the film’s inquiry into the limits of visibility maps the influence of territory on communal behaviors and identities while signaling the overlap</p>

        <p class="six">between dynamics such as politics and science. James N. Kienitz Wilkins’s This Action Lies (2018) is one the biennial’s highlights. The film is “a paranoid polyphonic apology of a simple act” offering three perspectives of a simple object: a Styrofoam to-go cup. Using the personal standpoint of an extended and often humorous monologue, This Action Lies weaves together a large socioeconomic constellation around such an underappreciated commercial product. The work’s impactful mise en abyme emerging out of the several visual reframings and the text’s form and content, drawing disparate references wrapped in a monotonous and confessional tone, produces a powerful statement regarding the interpenetration of the social in the self, while echoing the history of experimental film, referencing Hollis Frampton or Morgan Fisher.</p>
