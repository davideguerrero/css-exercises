        <h3>Biennale de l’Image en Mouvement at Centre d’Art Contemporain, Geneve</h3>
        <h1>THE Sound of Screens Imploding</h1>
        <p class="one">Since the 1960s and 1970s boom of international style high-rise construction, reflecting surfaces have become the shimmering face of capital flows and power dynamics. Employing mirrors as an illusionary, camouflaging agent, this representational regime offers a paradoxical discourse that disguises power by reflecting the outside onto itself. Today the regime of reflection has been supposedly replaced by a narrative produced during the digital turn and embodied by Silicon Valley:</p>
        <p class="two">the myth of transparency, in which it is proclaimed that a heightened degree of communication and interdependence will make societies more cohesive and controllable, and less prone to abuse. “Fitter, happier, more productive.”</p>
        <p class="three">But the current profusion of communication surfaces has not brought about a more comprehensive understanding and control of power dynamics, nor an increase in real connectivity; rather it seems to have further enhanced the reflecting agency of capital and representation while atomizing individuals.</p>
