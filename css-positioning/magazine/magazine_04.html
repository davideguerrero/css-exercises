        <p class="one">If on the one hand implosion as concept-image mimics the fragmentation and dissolution of the traditional collective experience with the visual, on the other it also signals the ambition to counteract or at least critique such atomization. Indeed and on a literal note, the figure of the mobile phone or the tablet as a means to display images, so common in contemporary art contexts just a </p>

        <p class="three">few years ago, is notably absent. Inversely, the privileges large-scale projected where sculpture and/or architecture play an important role, a gesture emphasizing the physicality of space and body in the encounter with images, which was also key to the visceral performance program showcasing Elysia Crampton, Ligia Lewis, Pan Daijing, and Angela Dimayuga and Meriem Bennani’s dinner.</p>
        <p class="four">On the CAC’s top floor, Tamara Henderson’s Womb Life (2018) forefronts and images. Her installations “choreograph space as a film set,” approaching “the floor as and transforming it into a system which is both kinetic and still.” Such concern around spatial configuration and materiality is explored throughout the exhibition. Korakrit Arunanondchai and people with funny names 5 (2018), an immersive installation comprising three videos and several sculptural elements. Proposing touching by means other than physical contact as a possible action, the work propels a form of spirituality, exploring being human in the age of multiple information processing.</p>
        <p class="five">Meriem Bennani’s multichannel Party on the CAPS (2018) imagines a world reconfigured. Taking place on an isolated island in the Atlantic Ocean, it displacement imposed on refugees and immigrants by states worldwide. Displacement, of fortified borders, which has expanded from fifteen. Walled Unwalled (2018) connects this context with the concurrent discovery of muons, invisible cosmic particles that pass through surfaces impervious to X-rays, penetrating what were once regarded as established boundaries.</p>

        <p class="six">Abu Hamdan’s ongoing exploration of the pervasive contemporary regime of hypervisibility. At the club night hosted by Nkisi, Crystallmess, and the extraordinary Abyss X, opaque, smoked space punctuated by irregular laser lights and deep sounds. The sensorial environment molded the audience into a single body, an anonymous mass whose empathy for one another organically counteracted the isolation key to the age of self-representation, and at the same time implemented a regime of invisibility. The enactment of such a movement </p>
        <p class="seven">of sound and bodies in space demonstrated the possibility of a shared moment of difference and otherness. Aptly echoing the antimatter research undertaken nearby at CERN, the event enacted a passage from the reflection of the outside and the monetization of the inside to a shared refraction of the self, together expressing interiority in an environment that forcibly reverberated to the radiant sound of screens imploding.</p>
